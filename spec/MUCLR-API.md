= MUCLR =
Multi-User Common Lisp REPL
Version 1.10.101 Alpha

== PURPOSE ==
For reasons both technical and social, the open-source community's ratio of
rewriting to expanding is far too large; while I'll not go into philosophy
here, suffice to say that :MUCLR aims to change the way that Common Lisp hack-
ers can work together on a project. Rather than the tried & true method of git-
like forking, modification, request for pullback, then final pull, we aim to
offer a shared REPL space accessible, and separate, from your local Common Lisp
REPL instance.
