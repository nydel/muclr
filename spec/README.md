**Multi-User Common Lisp REPL Specification**

The `MUCLR` package, including its sub-systems and API, is hereby canonically [technologically standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification) as outlined in the local  [MUCLR-SPEC](https://github.com/nydel/muclr/blob/master/spec/MUCLR-SPEC.md) markdown file.

A visual of the specification, as it develops, is being created using [VYM](http://www.insilmaril.de/vym/), or View Your Mind, an open-source mind-mapping system available on sourceforge. We aim to keep a `PNG` export of the current-most [MUCLR VYM](https://github.com/nydel/muclr/blob/master/spec/muclr.vym) available right [here](https://github.com/nydel/muclr/blob/master/spec/muclr-vym.png).

Please address any questions about the `MUCLR` project, its specifications, and beyond to @nydel; the best way to do this is to [email muclr](mailto:dev@muclr.org) directly with a concise subject and detailed message body. We appreciate your interest and will get back to you at our absolute earliest convenience.
